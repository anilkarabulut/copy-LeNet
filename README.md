# crossageeffect
A Keras based, DeepNet Age Classifier. The behavioural test is moved to: http://cagataygursoy.xyz.  
It is subject to change as the app is directly related with my MSc thesis work.

Update @ 23.02.2019
Old code for Behavioural test is moved to legacy folder.  
A new folder for Keras based DeepNet Age Classifier is created and necessary files were uploaded. Comments for each file will be inserted in order to increase readability of the code.

Update @ 07.10.2018  
The Python code is updated as a new facial image dataset from Park Aging Mind Lab at UTDallas has arrived.  
You can find further info about them from the following webpage: http://agingmind.utdallas.edu  

Update @ 18.05.2018  
You can find the executable Python files below, for Windows and MacOS separately.  
Windows version: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FmdAbw2mwW0-4X-QHtndPpR4rchVgm8w  
MacOS version: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fZiERz0EuyGXVAgxd4mgMCSUDSW2ftNp  

Update @ 15.05.2018:  
I decided to have Python version as well, since obtaining an executable version is easier in Python. Moreover, I have made slight changes in Matlab version.  

Previously used face image dataset is provided from FG-NET group's facial database.  
About FG-NET: http://www-prima.inrialpes.fr/FGnet/html/about.html  
Since FG-NET is not distributing their database right now, I have reached their dataset thanks to Yangwei Fu.
