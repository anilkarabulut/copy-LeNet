# crossageeffect
A Matlab and Python based, executable, Cross-Age Effect test app. It is subject to change as the app directly related with my MSc thesis work. 

Update @ 15.05.2018:
I decided to have Python version as well, since obtaining an executable version is easier in Python. Moreover, I have made slight changes in Matlab version.

Currently used face image dataset is provided from FG-NET group's facial database.

Since FG-NET is not distributing their database right now, I have reached their dataset thanks to Yangwei Fu.
